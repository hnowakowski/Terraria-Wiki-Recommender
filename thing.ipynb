    "# Introduction\n",
    "This project recommends similar articles from the terraria wiki based on text contents of said articles. Our dataset is comprised of a total of 1000 different pages scraped off of `terraria.wiki.gg`. We have chosen this wiki in particular for 3 main reasons:\n",
    "1. The person writing this likes the game and knows it very well :^)\n",
    "2. The amount of articles on this wiki is a little under 6 thousand, so we could get decent coverage with a sane amount of articles downloaded.\n",
    "3. A lot of mechanics, NPC's, items, events, bosses, etc. in this game affect and depend each other, so we were hoping to see some interesting relations between articles."

    "### Approach and libraries used\n",
    "We have taken the approach of starting on the main page of the wiki, collecting all the hyperlinks leading to other pages into a queue, and performing bfs. On every page we visited from that point onwards, we took all of the text from the main article div, as well as added all the non-visted hyperlinks into the queue for further search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world we'd have been able to just blast requests as fast as possible and be done with downloading the dataset within a few minutes at most. The scraping guidelines of the wiki, however, have specified a 1 second cooldown between requests. This still wouldn't have been too bad, but even a 1 second cooldown was short enough to trigger cloudflare's captchas and eventually put the scraper's ip on a blacklist for a few hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "This forced us to ditch the regular requests library in favour of cloudscraper, which works in a nigh-identical way, but employs some protections and workarounds for cloudflare's protections specifically. After a bit of trial and error with request cooldowns and headers, we have arrived at a working solution visible below. This implementation allowed us to scrape aforementioned 1000 articles within a *servicable* timeframe of a little over 40 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from some hurdles with overcoming anti-bot protection, the remainder of scraping the data was very straightforward - a very standardised layout of the wiki's pages allowed us to just inspect a given div on each article for both text content and other links.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downloaded dataset has been put into a `raw_text.csv` file for further processing explained in the next section.\n",

    "For this section have decided to go with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). As mentioned earlier, with this approach having common stop words in the dataset does not have a large impact on the results, as aforementioned stop words have an insanely low significance in scoring. On the contrary, the existence of very specific terms boosts similarity between articles immensly.\n",

    "\n",
    "We take the title of an article from the database as a query, and after comparing the similarities between its vectorized form and various rows in `df_vectorized`, take the top 10 highest similarity matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of several articles (a history of visited articles) we simply concatenate all of their texts into a single string and run it through the same pipeline as above.\n",
